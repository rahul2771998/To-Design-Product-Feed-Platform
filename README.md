Product feed platform
A platform that provides sellers a way to showcase their products.
Seller is someone who publishes product posts.
● Sellers can publish posts. A post contains product details. Eg. Product name, Price, category
etc.
● A seller has a rating which is a constant in the beginning.
A customer has an interest in these posts
● Customers can subscribe to sellers.
● Customers can unsubscribe to sellers.
A Customer has access to a product feed where they can see posts by sellers whom they have
subscribed to.
Product Feed Platform:
● Customers only see posts that are posted by sellers they have subscribed to.
● Sellers can delete a post, if a post is deleted a customer won't see it in their feed. If a seller is
deleted, all their posts should get deleted.
● Customer can fetch subscribed feeds based on ranking function, one ranking function will be
default:
Feed ranking will be based on a single ranking function at a time.
■ Sort by recency of post (Default and mandatory)
■ Sort by seller rating (optional)

Seller’s current rating will be function of total upvotes & downvotes on their posts. For
simplicity consider rating = Positive of [5 * (total upvotes)/(total upvotes + total downvotes)]. ie.
Here 5 is beginning rating.
Expectations:
1. Make sure that you have working, functionally correct and demonstrable code.
2. Work on the expected output first and then add good-to-have features of your own.
3. Code should be modular, readable and testable.
4. Separation of concern should be addressed.

Other Details:
1. Do not use any database or NoSQL store, use in-memory data-structure for simplicity.

3. Write a driver class for demo purpose. Which will execute all the features at one place in the
code to test all cases.
